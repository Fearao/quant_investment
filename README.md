# quant_investment
Here I will share my exercises about quant investment, including stock market and digital currency!
In this exercise, I used macd strategy to decide my all order about buy and sell.
In the MACD strategy, when the diff(difference) line exceeds the DEA line, we execute a buy order. In contrary, we execute a sell order.
There is a .png file show the yield rate of this strategy, the kline data is downloaded from choice terminal. Stock ID is 510500, which yield rate achieve 40% through 3 years.
I will try to imporve it by adding more factors in the stratrgy.
